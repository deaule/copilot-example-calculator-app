# Java Calculator App Requirements

## Project Overview
A simple desktop calculator application built with Java and JavaFX that provides basic arithmetic operations with an intuitive graphical user interface.
Should use Maven for dependency management

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Basic Arithmetic Operations
- **Description**: The calculator must support the four basic arithmetic operations
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (-)
  - Multiplication (×)
  - Division (÷)
  - All operations must handle decimal numbers
  - Division by zero must display an error message

### FR-2: Number Input
- **Description**: Users must be able to input numbers using both buttons and keyboard
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Support for digits 0-9
  - Support for decimal point (.)
  - Support for negative numbers
  - Maximum display length of 15 digits
  - Input validation to prevent invalid number formats

### FR-3: Display System
- **Description**: A clear display showing current input, operation, and results
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Primary display for current number/result
  - Secondary display showing current calculation expression
  - Right-aligned text display
  - Auto-sizing text for long numbers
  - Clear error messages when appropriate

### FR-4: Clear Operations
- **Description**: Functions to clear input and reset calculator state
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Clear Entry (CE) - clears current input only
  - All Clear (AC) - resets calculator to initial state
  - Backspace - removes last entered digit

## User Stories

### Epic: Basic Calculator Operations

#### Story 1: Perform Basic Arithmetic
**As a** user  
**I want to** perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)  
**So that** I can calculate simple mathematical expressions  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I enter "5 + 3", when I press equals, then I see "8"
- Given I enter "10 - 4", when I press equals, then I see "6"
- Given I enter "7 × 3", when I press equals, then I see "21"
- Given I enter "15 ÷ 3", when I press equals, then I see "5"
- Given I enter "10 ÷ 0", when I press equals, then I see "Error: Division by zero"

#### Story 2: Enter Numbers
**As a** user  
**I want to** input numbers using on-screen buttons or keyboard  
**So that** I can enter values for calculations  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I click number buttons, when I click "1", "2", "3", then the display shows "123"
- Given I use keyboard input, when I type "456", then the display shows "456"
- Given I want decimal numbers, when I enter "3.14", then the display shows "3.14"
- Given I enter more than 15 digits, when I continue typing, then additional digits are ignored

#### Story 3: View Calculation History
**As a** user  
**I want to** see my current calculation expression  
**So that** I can verify what operation I'm performing  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I enter "5 +", when I look at the secondary display, then I see "5 +"
- Given I complete "5 + 3 =", when I look at the secondary display, then I see "5 + 3 ="
- Given I start a new calculation, when I enter a number, then the secondary display clears

### Epic: Advanced Features

#### Story 4: Clear and Correct Input
**As a** user  
**I want to** clear my input or reset the calculator  
**So that** I can correct mistakes or start fresh  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I have "123" entered, when I press backspace, then the display shows "12"
- Given I have entered an incorrect number, when I press "CE", then only the current entry is cleared
- Given I want to start completely over, when I press "AC", then all values and operations are cleared

#### Story 5: Handle Errors Gracefully
**As a** user  
**I want to** receive clear error messages for invalid operations  
**So that** I understand what went wrong and can continue using the calculator  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I attempt to divide by zero, when I press equals, then I see "Error: Division by zero"
- Given an error is displayed, when I press any number or operation, then the error clears and normal operation resumes
- Given I enter an invalid sequence, when the error occurs, then the calculator remains responsive

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance
- Calculator operations must respond within 100ms
- Application startup time must not exceed 3 seconds
- Memory usage should not exceed 50MB during normal operation

### NFR-2: Usability
- Button size must be at least 40x40 pixels for easy clicking
- Font size must be readable (minimum 14pt for display)
- Keyboard shortcuts must work for all major operations
- Interface must be intuitive for users familiar with standard calculators

### NFR-3: Reliability
- Application must handle all edge cases without crashing
- Invalid input must be gracefully rejected with user feedback
- Application must maintain state consistency throughout operation

### NFR-4: Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Must run on Windows, macOS, and Linux with Java 11+
- JavaFX runtime must be properly bundled or documented for deployment
- Display must scale appropriately on different screen resolutions

## Technical Requirements

### TR-1: Technology Stack
- **Language**: Java 11 or higher
- **UI Framework**: JavaFX 11+
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Testing**: JUnit 5 for unit tests

### TR-2: Architecture
- Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern
- Separation of business logic from UI components
- Event-driven user interface
- Modular design for easy maintenance and testing

### TR-3: Code Quality
- Minimum 80% unit test coverage

## UI Layout Requirements

### Main Window
- **Size**: 300x400 pixels (minimum), resizable
