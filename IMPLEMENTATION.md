- Initializes MVC components
- Configures main window and scene
- Sets up CSS styling

#### `CalculatorModel.java` (Business Logic)
- All arithmetic operations: +, -, ×, ÷
- BigDecimal for precise calculations
- Support for decimal numbers and negative numbers
- Maximum 15-digit display limit
- Error handling (division by zero, overflow)
- Clear operations (AC, CE) and backspace
- Operation chaining support

#### `CalculatorView.java` (User Interface)
- Complete JavaFX UI with proper button layout
- 4×5 button grid as specified in requirements
- Keyboard input support (all shortcuts implemented)
- Primary and secondary display areas
- Responsive styling and focus handling

#### `CalculatorController.java` (Event Handling)
- MVC coordination between model and view
- Event handlers for all buttons
- Display updates based on model state
- Error state management

### 3. Features Implemented

#### FR-1: Basic Arithmetic Operations ✅
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Decimal number support
- Division by zero error handling

#### FR-2: Number Input ✅
- Digits 0-9 via buttons and keyboard
- Decimal point support
- Negative number toggle (± button)
- 15-digit maximum display length
- Input validation

#### FR-3: Display System ✅
- Primary display for current number/result
- Secondary display for calculation expressions
- Right-aligned text
- Error message display
- Auto-sizing font support

#### FR-4: Clear Operations ✅
- Clear Entry (CE) - clears current input only
- All Clear (AC) - resets calculator completely
- Backspace - removes last digit

### 4. User Stories Implementation

- Separated business logic
- Event-driven UI
- Modular design

#### TR-3: Code Quality ✅
- Comprehensive unit tests (80%+ coverage target)
- JavaDoc documentation
- Clean, maintainable code
- Proper error handling

### 7. Testing Implementation

#### Unit Tests
- `CalculatorModelTest.java`: 25+ test methods covering all business logic
- `CalculatorControllerTest.java`: Controller and UI interaction tests
- `CalculatorIntegrationTest.java`: End-to-end workflow tests

#### Test Coverage
- All arithmetic operations
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Input validation
- State management
- User workflows

### 8. Build and Deployment

#### Build Scripts
- `build-and-run.bat` (Windows)
- `build-and-run.sh` (Unix/Linux/macOS)
- Maven configuration for executable JAR

#### VS Code Integration
- Complete task configuration (`.vscode/tasks.json`)
- Launch configurations (`.vscode/launch.json`)
- Project settings (`.vscode/settings.json`)

#### Project Files
- `README.md`: Comprehensive documentation
- `.gitignore`: Proper exclusions
- CSS styling for modern UI

### 9. UI Layout (As Specified)

```
[AC] [CE] [←]  [÷]
[7]  [8]  [9]  [×]
[4]  [5]  [6]  [-]
[1]  [2]  [3]  [+]
[±]  [0]  [.]  [=]
```
